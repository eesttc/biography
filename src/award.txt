awa Nobel Prize in Physics 1903

The 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to three scientists: Marie Curie, her husband Pierre Curie, and Henri Becquerel. They were honored for their pioneering research on radioactivity, a phenomenon that Becquerel had discovered in 1896.

Henri Becquerel discovered that certain uranium salts emitted radiation without needing sunlight. This finding opened new avenues for research on radioactivity. The Curies continued the research by identifying two new elements, polonium and radium. They conducted detailed experiments to measure the radioactivity of these elements.




awa Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1911

The 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Marie Curie for her research on radioactive elements, particularly for the isolation of radium and polonium. She became the first woman to receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Marie Curie developed methods to extract radium from uranium ore, which required sophisticated chemical techniques and high precision. She conducted hundreds of experiments to achieve the necessary purity of this element.

She also discovered the element polonium during her research, enriching the understanding of radioactive elements.



awa Davy Medal 1903

The Davy Medal is awarded for outstanding contributions to the field of chemistry. In 1903, Marie and Pierre Curie were recognized for their pioneering research on radioactivity, particularly their work related to the discovery and identification of radioactive elements such as radium and polonium.

They conducted important experiments to determine the properties of radioactive elements, opening new understandings of atomic structure and how these elements interact. The Davy Medal also acknowledged the close collaboration between the Curies in their research, showcasing their teamwork and dedication to science.

Marie Curie's receipt of the Davy Medal alongside her husband was a significant advancement, affirming the role of women in science, a field where women were often restricted at that time.




awa Matteucci Medal 1904

The Matteucci Medal is awarded for outstanding achievements in the fields of physics and chemistry. The Curies received this honor for their pioneering work on radioactivity, which included groundbreaking discoveries about radioactive elements.

The Curies conducted extensive research that led to the discovery of radium and polonium, expanding the understanding of radioactive materials. They developed new methods for isolating radioactive elements, which required advanced chemical techniques and meticulous experimentation.






awa Acton Prize 1907

The Acton Prize is given for outstanding achievements in the natural sciences. Marie Curie's receipt of this prize underscored her pioneering work in radioactivity, which had already garnered significant international attention.

Curie's groundbreaking discoveries included the identification and isolation of the radioactive elements radium and polonium. Her research significantly advanced the understanding of atomic structure and radioactivity. Her work laid the groundwork for future applications of radioactivity in medicine, particularly in cancer treatment.





awa Elliott Cresson Medal 1909

The Elliott Cresson Medal is awarded for notable achievements in science and technology. Curie's receipt of this medal reflected her pioneering research in radioactivity and her status as a leading scientist of her time.

 Curie's groundbreaking work included the discovery and isolation of radioactive elements, notably radium and polonium, which revolutionized the understanding of atomic properties and radioactivity. Her findings laid the foundation for future applications in fields such as medicine, particularly in cancer treatment through radiation therapy.





awa Franklin Medal of the American Philosophical Society 1921

The Franklin Medal is awarded for achievements in science and technology that have made a significant impact on society. Curie's receipt of this medal acknowledged her pioneering research in radioactivity and her role as a leading scientific figure.

Curie's groundbreaking work involved the discovery and isolation of radioactive elements, particularly radium and polonium. Her research fundamentally changed the understanding of atomic structure and radioactivity. Her discoveries laid the groundwork for the use of radiation in medicine, particularly in the treatment of cancer.




awa Entities Named After Marie Curie

The curie (symbol Ci), a unit of radioactivity, is named in honour of her and Pierre Curie (although the commission which agreed on the name never clearly stated whether the standard was named after Pierre, Marie, or both).

The element with atomic number 96 was named curium (symbol Cm).

Three radioactive minerals are also named after the Curies: curite, sklodowskite, and cuprosklodowskite.

The Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions fellowship program of the European Union for young scientists wishing to work in a foreign country.

In 2007 a Paris metro station (in Ivry) was renamed after the two Curies.

The Marie-Curie station, a planned underground Réseau express métropolitain (REM) station in the borough of Saint-Laurent in Montreal is named in her honour. A nearby road, Avenue Marie Curie, is also named in her honour.

The Polish research nuclear reactor Maria.

The 7000 Curie asteroid.

Curie is the subject of the 2013 play False Assumptions by Lawrence Aronovitch, in which the ghosts of three other women scientists observe events in her life. Curie has also been portrayed by Susan Marie Frontczak in her play, Manya: The Living History of Marie Curie, a one-woman show which by 2014 had been performed in 30 U.S. states and nine countries. Lauren Gunderson's 2019 play The Half-Life of Marie Curie portrays Curie during the summer after her 1911 Nobel Prize victory, when she was grappling with depression and facing public scorn over the revelation of her affair with Paul Langevin.

The life of the scientist was also the subject of a 2018 Korean musical, titled Marie Curie. The show was since translated in English (as Marie Curie a New Musical) and has been performed several times across Asia and Europe, receiving its official Off West End premiere in London's Charing Cross Theatre in summer 2024.

Curie has appeared on more than 600 postage stamps in many countries across the world.
